Approach

1. I created a Git repository called BasicBlogApplication.
2. I created a Laravel project called assignment.
3. I created a database called assignment.
4. I configured the .env file with the database details.
5. I defined routes in web.php.
6. I created the master layout in app.blade.php.
7. I created Blade views for the index page.
8. I adjusted the PostController to display the index page.
9. I created a folder called Posts that contains all the Blade views.
10. I implemented CRUD operations in the PostController.
11. I generated the Post model and created the migration for the posts table.
12. I continuously modified my views until they represented what I wanted.
13. I created the edit view and the delete view last.
14. I created the Post factory and the seeder, and seeded the database.

Challenges
1. Most of my work is based on lectures. The challenges I faced included debugging when the code was not working, often due to spelling mistakes.
2. Another challenge was designing the pages. I attempted to make the web pages look more aesthetically pleasing, but I am not skilled in that area.

Bonus Extra Feature
I added a confirmation dialog to ensure that users do not accidentally delete pages. Users are prompted to click "Yes" or "No" before the page is permanently deleted.
